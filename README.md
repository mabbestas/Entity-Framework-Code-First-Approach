# Entity-Framework-Code-First-Approach

In Code First approach, entities or classes are created first with the primary focus on the domain of an application. You can start creating classes and required properties, without designing the database that matches the entities. Then the Entity Framework creates the tables and database accordingly and when the code is run, the database is created. Code-First is mainly useful in Domain Driven Design.

As you can see in the above figure, EF API will create the database based on your domain classes and configuration. This means you need to start coding first in C# or VB.NET and then EF will create the database from your code.

## Code-First Workflow

The following figure illustrates the code-first development workflow.
